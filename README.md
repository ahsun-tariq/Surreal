## Introduction and Project Concept
Open world RPG games are becoming exceedingly popular as they provide an opportunity to explore an aesthetically rich environment and follow various quests. I have always been fascinated by games such as Skyrim, The Witcher and Fallout, where it is possible to explore different towns and learn more about the characters, lore and history. My learning objective is to skill myself in designing similar towns that are visually attractive and offer a sense of exploration. Thus, I am designing a small picturesque open world where the player will be able to complete a few quests.

## Narrative 
The main aspects I am focusing on are mages, magic and wilderness. The protagonist is on an adventure of becoming a mage and he travels into a forgotten land to learn more about magic. This idea is based on a quote mentioned in Alamanac, “Only one in ten thousand have the necessary skills to become a mage.” Another influence is from the Fedran character, Mistan, who spent most of her time reading and writing about many hidden beautiful places but could not see any of them during her lifetime. Thus, the player finds himself lost in one such beautiful world of magic that offers an opportunity of becoming a mage. 
External elements that have influenced my imagination include The Witcher 3 Blood and Wine, Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (particularly the area of Darkfall Cave and Mages’ College), World of Warcraft and Alice in Wonderland.

## Design and Modelling
I have worked on creating an abandoned world which seems rather unusual and under the influence of magic. I considered two choices for creating this world. One option would be to make it dark, gloomy and chaotic while the second option would be to make it strangely scenic, colourful and vibrant. I went with the second choice for the reason that it may appear more bewildering to the players and also capture their attention through the scenery. I thought about the assets that would make a place look magi-cal and scenic at the same time. I came up with the idea of giant mushrooms, cottages, medieval towers and a castle.

I have spent most of the time modelling assets in Maya. First, I designed some as-sets that would be generic and reusable such as windows and fences. Then, I modelled some assets that would set up the environment such as towers and mushrooms. Modularity helped me to take a bot-tom-up approach and build more complex structures from simpler modules. For example, the castle shown below was modelled by reusing and resizing a set of simple low-poly modules including a gate, wall, window, tower and keep. I have  reused modular structures as needed. For example, the castle was made using same modules, by resizing and rearranging them. Similarly, buildings and houses have been designed by using same structures but rearranging, retexturing and scaling to create a bit of diversity. Another important visual aspect was to use colours and textures so that they blend together creating an intensely vivid environment. For example, pink can be seen on tower roofs, yellow and red on flowers, green on vegetation etc. Thus, blending different colours provided the essence of an aesthetically rich world.
